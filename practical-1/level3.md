### 📚 Commands You'll Need
- `cd`: Change directory
- `ls`: List files and directories
- `pwd`: Print working directory
- `cat`: Concatenate and display file contents .
- `tab` key: Autocomplete file names .

### 🏁 The Challenge
In Level 3, you'll encounter an empty directory. AHHHHHHHHHHHH! 🙀 
Maybe something is hidden - if oyu can find it you'll win.
**the solution method**
- Searching for hidden files using the `ls` command with the addition of the `-a` option to show hidden files .
- Reading the hidden file using the `cat` command with a period (`.`) at the beginning of the hidden file is necessary for proper identification.

**Here's what you need to do** :
- Use the `ls` command to see the files and directories in your current location. (maybe a subcommand we can do to help us?)
- Use `cat` to read the content
