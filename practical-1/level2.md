# livel2 ==> level3 :

## Log in to the level : 
    - user : **level2** :
    - password : **level2forTheWinnn** :

### 📚 Commands You'll Need
- `cd`: Change directory
- `ls`: List files and directories
- `pwd`: Print working directory
- `cat`: Concatenate and display file contents .
- `tab` key: Autocomplete file names .

### 🏁 The Challenge
In Level 2, you'll encounter files with special characters in their names, specifically dashes (`-`). These files hold the key to unlocking Level 3, but accessing them requires a bit of finesse.
### the solution method
Open the file named `-` using the cat command with `./-`
**Here's what you need to do** :
- Use the `ls` command to see the files and directories in your current location.
- Among the listed files, you'll notice a file called `-`
- you will need to figure out how to open folders with special characters.

## Lessons Learned
- In this lesson, I learned how to read a file that cannot be read under normal circumstances, named `-`, and how to read it using the `cat` command.
