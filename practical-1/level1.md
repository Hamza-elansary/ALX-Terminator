# livel1 ==> level2 :

## Log in to the level : 
    - user : **level1** :
    - password : **level1iseasy** :

### 📚 Commands You'll Need
- `cd`: Change directory
- `ls`: List files and directories
- `pwd`: Print working directory
- `su`: Switch user
- `cat`: Concatenate and display file contents

### 🏁 The Challenge
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find the hidden password that will grant you access to Level 2. The password is concealed within a file named `password.txt`, located in your home directory.

**Here's what you need to do** :
 -  Use the `ls` command to see the files and directories in your current location.
 -  Use the `pwd` command to check your current directory.
 -  If you're not in your home directory, use the `cd` command to navigate there.
 -  Once you're in your home directory, use the `ls` command again to locate the `password.txt` file.
 -  Use the `cat` command followed by the filename to display the contents of `password.txt`.

## Lessons Learned
- In this lesson, I learned how to read a text file using the `cat` command.
