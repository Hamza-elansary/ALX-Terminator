# livel5 ==> level6 :

## Log in to the level : 
    - user : **level5** :
    - password : **level5basicallymrRob0t** :

### 📚 Commands You'll Need
- `cd`: Change directory
- `ls`: List files and directories
- `pwd`: Print working directory
- `cat`: Concatenate and display file contents .
- `tab` key: Autocomplete file names .
- `grep`: Search for patterns within files.
- `|` : Passing the result from one command to another .

### 🏁 The Challenge
In Level 5, you'll need to find the hidden password that will grant you victory in the game. You'll have to use the power of `grep` to search for the password.

**the solution method**
- Use the `cat` command to read the text file, then pass the output using the `|` symbol for the `grep` command.

**Here's what you need to do** :
- Use the `ls` command to see the files and directories in your current location.
- The password is hidden within our password file, and the line containing the password has the word "password" in it.

## Lessons Learned
- In this lesson, I learned how to search within a text file for a word using the `grep` command.
