# livel7 ==> level8 :

## Log in to the level : 
    - user : **level7** :
    - password : **level7masterhacker** :

### 📚 Commands You'll Need
- `cd`: Change directory
- `ls`: List files and directories
- `pwd`: Print working directory
- `cat`: Concatenate and display file contents .
- `tab` key: Autocomplete file names .
- `grep`: Search for patterns within files.
- `|` : Passing the result from one command to another .
- `cp` : copy files and directories
- `base64` : Encode or decode Base64 data .

### 🏁 The Challenge
In Level 7, you'll encounter a file that contains a Base64 encoded version of the password. To unlock the next level, you'll need to decode the Base64 encoded string.

**the solution method**
- Use the `base64` command with the `-d` option to decompress.

**Here's what you need to do** :
- Use the ls command to see the files and directories in your current location .
- Read the password file and find an encoded password. 
- Decode level up!😄

## Lessons Learned
- In this lesson, I learned how to use the `base64` command with the `-d` option to decrypt a file.
