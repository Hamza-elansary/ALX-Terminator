### 📚 Commands You'll Need
- `cd`: Change directory
- `ls`: List files and directories
- `pwd`: Print working directory
- `cat`: Concatenate and display file contents .
- `tab` key: Autocomplete file names .

### 🏁 The Challenge
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find the IP address of this container. The container's IP address is the password that will grant you access to the next level. Sometimes the simplist answer is the right one. Maybe you dont even need to find out its IP address as you already know where its home is.
